                    <h1>Tesla Autopilot alerts driver of upcoming cyclist even before they see them</h1>
                    <p>Tesla’s Autopilot recently helped a driver to recognize and avoid a bicyclist who was traveling on the shoulder of a road.</p>
                    <p>Dirty Tesla, YouTuber and Model 3 owner, displayed his vehicle’s impressive ability to identify and warn him of the bicyclist before he had the opportunity to begin navigation away.</p>
                    <p>Dirty Tesla’s Model 3 was utilizing software version 2020.12.6, which was released on April 24 in a broad rollout of the company’s new Traffic Light and Stop Sign recognition feature.</p>
                    <p>While impressive that the vehicle was able to detect the bicyclist before the driver, what is perhaps even more striking was the car’s ability to visualize the man on the bike on the vehicle’s dash screen before the driver saw him.</p>

                    <p>Dirty Tesla was filming his use of Autopilot’s newest feature in a controlled environment. But before he could see with his eyes what was coming, his vehicle was able to alert the driver of a cyclist on the road ahead.</p>
                    <p>Tesla’s Full Self-Driving suite has come a long way in the past year. With the additions of Smart Summon and Traffic Light and Stop Sign recognition, the only thing left for Tesla to implement is inner-city driving. While half of the battle is recognizing stops signs, traffic lights, and safe intersection maneuvering, the other half is maintaining the safety of pedestrians who will be maintaining the safety of pedestrians who will be present on sidewalks, crosswalks, and bikes within a city’s limits.</p>
