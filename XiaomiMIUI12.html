                    <h4>MIUI 12 in the other countries</h4>
                    <p>Apart from the first batch, it is not clear that in which month the second and third batches will be receiving the update. Xiaomi is also yet to announce the availability of MIUI 12 in India. However, it’s just a matter of time before the company reveals the details on this.</p>
                    <h4>MIUI features</h4>
                    <p>The new MIUI 12 brings with it revamped graphics, animations, new gestures, live wallpapers, privacy and accessibility features among other add-ons. With the new update, the company has said that the users will be able to see text more clearly due to the white background and ample spacing between texts. Animations like screen rotation, app launch and close and rearranging the icons can be expected to get a new and smooth feel. New Earth and Mars live wallpaper have also been added. Enabling night mode will cause the planets to enter night as well.</p>
                    <p>As for privacy, Xiaomi said that it has passed the ‘Android Enhanced Privacy Protection Test’ done by TÜV Rheinland. A new feature called Flare takes care of all the permissions attainer by the apps and is sensitive towards apps using GPS and camera. After installing MIUI 12, users can also grant permissions to an app only for a specified amount of time.</p>
                    <p>A new health feature allows recording activities including steps while consuming less than 1 percent battery throughout the day. For people with vocal/ hearing disabilities, an AI Calling feature has been added that transcribes the conversation in real-time to enable such people to respond using methods other than speaking.</p>
